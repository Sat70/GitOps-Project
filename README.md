GitOps-Based Deployment with Terraform, Docker, and AWS EKS
Overview :
This project demonstrates an end-to-end GitOps workflow for automating infrastructure deployment and application delivery using Terraform, Docker, and AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). The goal is to implement a declarative infrastructure where all configurations and deployments are managed via a Git repository, ensuring consistency, scalability, and automation.

Key Features :
1.Infrastructure as Code (IaC) â€“ Uses Terraform to provision AWS resources, including EKS clusters, VPCs, and IAM roles.
C2.ontainerized Application Deployment â€“ Packages a microservices-based application using Docker and deploys it to Kubernetes.
3.GitOps Workflow â€“ Implements ArgoCD to automate deployments whenever there is a code change in the Git repository.
4.CI/CD Integration â€“ Uses GitHub Actions to trigger Terraform and application deployments.
5.Scalability & High Availability â€“ Designed for autoscaling and fault tolerance with Kubernetes.

Tech Stack :
1.Version Control: Git, GitHub
2.Infrastructure Management: Terraform
3.Containerization: Docker
4.Orchestration: Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
5.GitOps Tool: ArgoCD
6.CI/CD: GitHub Actions
7.Cloud Provider: AWS (EKS, IAM, VPC, S3)
8.Monitoring: Prometheus & Grafana

Project Workflow :
1.Infrastructure Provisioning : Terraform scripts define and create AWS EKS clusters.
IAM roles, VPC, and networking are configured for Kubernetes.
2.Application Containerization : A sample application is containerized using Docker.
Docker images are pushed to Amazon ECR or Docker Hub.
3.GitOps Deployment with ArgoCD : ArgoCD watches the Git repository and automatically syncs deployments to EKS.
Kubernetes manifests (Helm charts/YAML files) are stored in the repo.
4.CI/CD Pipeline : GitHub Actions triggers Terraform for infrastructure updates.
On code commits, GitHub Actions builds, tests, and pushes Docker images.
ArgoCD ensures Kubernetes deployments match the Git state.

Why GitOps?
Automated Deployments â€“ No manual intervention, deployments are triggered by Git commits.
Version Control for Infrastructure â€“ Ensures full traceability of infrastructure and application changes.
Faster Recovery â€“ Rollbacks are as simple as reverting to a previous commit.
Scalability â€“ Easily scale applications and infrastructure without downtime.
Future Enhancements
Add Helm charts for more scalable deployments.
Implement Kustomize for environment-specific configurations.
Integrate service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for enhanced security and observability.
Add RBAC policies for access control in Kubernetes.

Conclusion:
This project provides a fully automated GitOps pipeline for managing infrastructure and application deployments in a scalable and secure way. By leveraging Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and ArgoCD, this workflow ensures that changes are tracked, reproducible, and rollback-safe, making it an ideal approach for modern cloud-native deployments.
